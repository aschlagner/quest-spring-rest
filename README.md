# SEA8 - Spring Quest - REST

## Challenge: Save the library, save the world

Congratulations, you've just been appointed great librarian of the Wild Code School!

Based on what you achieved in this quest, will you have the audacity to take up the extraordinary challenge of creating a Spring RESTful application to manage the books available in your library?
To do this, follow the following steps:

1. Create a MySQL database and initialize a Spring project communicating with it
2. Create an entity **Book** with the following attributes **title**, **author** and **description**
3. Create a **BookRepository** allowing to perform the 4 CRUD operations + a search operation by keyword contained in the title or description
4. Set up a controller that meets REST criteria
5. Test the application in *Postman*
6. Send the project to its remote repository and share the link in solution.

## Validation criterias

All requests sent to the Spring application via *Postman* (verbs **GET**, **POST**, **PUT** and **DELETE**) work and return consistent responses.
